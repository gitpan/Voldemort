Voldemort - A perl client for Voldemort, the NoSQL server

Voldemort is a perl client which communicates in any configured 
message format, synchronously or asynchronously on connection.  Google's 
Protocol Buffers are the only prepackaged one.  Client side routing is not 
supported, though it may be trivial to implement Voldemort::Connection to do 
so.

To use Voldemort, Moose and Google Protocol Buffers are required.  To 
install Voldemort, issue the following.

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
